# Unreal-Battle-Tanks
****
Simple tank game involving simple AI, advanced controls, and terrain. 
Made using Unreal Engine 4.11, and following a [Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview)

## Concept
-	PvP game: destroy the other player's tank without being destroyed yourself
-	Terrain is both an obstacle and cover to be used
-	Primarily has to be fun to play: controls, reactions to hits, driving need to "feel" good

## Rules
-	can move anywhere
-	start with finite health and ammo
-	hits take away health
-	last man standing wins

## Requirements
Inputs: menu selections? controls for the tank, movement and attack mainly
Outputs: visual feedback, sounds, scores
tasks: simply destroy the other tank(s)
assets:
	-	SFX: gunfire, explosion, turret moving, engine sound
	-	Models: tanks, shells, bullets
	-	other: terrain map, terrain texture, particle effects
